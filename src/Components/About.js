        <h1>About Hogwarts</h1>
        <p>
          Welcome to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, the esteemed
          institution of magical education located in the heart of the Scottish
          Highlands. For centuries, Hogwarts has stood as a beacon of knowledge,
          nurturing young witches and wizards into skilled and responsible
          individuals who will shape the magical world. Founded over a thousand
          years ago by the four great wizards—Godric Gryffindor, Helga
          Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin—Hogwarts has since
          become a sanctuary for students seeking to hone their magical
          abilities. These founders carefully crafted the school's core values,
          emphasizing bravery, loyalty, wit, and ambition.
